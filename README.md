# fluent-mapper
A fluent object-to-object mapper for C#, inspired by Martin Fowler's [data mapper](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html).

For more information, please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/floyd-may/fluent-mapper/wiki) or take a look at the `.cs` files in `FluentMapping.Tests` to see how it works.
